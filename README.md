Deck of Cards

I chose to use C++ because that is what I learne in my CS courses here at BYU. I also chose to create a class that created objects of type Card. That way the object could have two attributes - the rank of the card(Ace - King) and suit.

When I felt there was ambiguity I simply made the decision that I felt would result in the most usable, clear and accurate code.

I would determine that my framework is working correctly by walking through the code line by line and double checking all of my code. I could not figure out one line of code, I knew that I had to create an array of type 'Card' but the syntax was giving me a hard time.
